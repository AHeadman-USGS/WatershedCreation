# WatershedCreation
ArcGIS based tools for automated watershed creation within the Watershed Boundary Dataset


Known possible bugs/issues:
Possible deprecition issues with the egis python lib when using Arc10.5.1 and ArcPro on the 
same system.  This might be a local issue, but I'm including it here.

Critical stop occurs when TempBuff is passed an empty feature class.

Possible issue when working with non-standard TNMID field.  have not been able to recreate.
